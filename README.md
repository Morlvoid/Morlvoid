Hello, I'm Mor, you can call me momo or Morlvoid. I'm from China.
<br>
你好！我是馍馍，也可以叫我Morlvoid。来自中国。
- 🌱 I'm working hard as a student to learn programming and development! Front-end development is really fun, 🎨and I hope to become a UX developer, software developer, and game developer who combines programming with anime and manga drawing.
- 正在学习前端开发，前端真是太好丸辣.jpg。先立个flag想做动画和代码结合的UX设计师。
- 🖌️ I believe the collision of code and art can be truly beautiful! In the future, my projects will be open-sourced on GitHub. 🐱 If you're also interested in development, let's connect!💌
- 如果你也喜欢秃头（划掉）请加入我的后宫（不是）。
